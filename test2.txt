For test purposes
should you care what is inside
nobody know
so 
stand by me
stand by me
cause nobody knows

it has been a long time since i rocked and rolled
rock and roll music
any old way you choose it

do you hate my guts

 I turn my body from the sun  What ho  Tashtego  let me hear thy
hammer  Oh  ye three unsurrendered spires of mine  thou uncracked
keel  and only god bullied hull  thou firm deck  and haughty helm
and Pole pointed prow  death glorious ship  must ye then perish  and
without me  Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked
captains  Oh  lonely death on lonely life  Oh  now I feel my topmost
greatness lies in my topmost grief  Ho  ho  from all your furthest
bounds  pour ye now in  ye bold billows of my whole foregone life
and top this one piled comber of my death  Towards thee I roll  thou
all destroying but unconquering whale  to the last I grapple with thee
from hell s heart I stab at thee  for hate s sake I spit my last
breath at thee  Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool
and since neither can be mine  let me then tow to pieces  while still
chasing thee  though tied to thee  thou damned whale  Thus  I give up
the spear
